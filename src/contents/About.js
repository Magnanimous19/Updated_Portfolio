                <p>I've lived in Okinawa, Japan for over 18 years and consider it home. I can still speak, read, and write Japanese even though 
                I've forgotten so much since moving to the states 4 years ago.
                <br></br>
                Since I can remember I've always enjoyed creating and building things whether it's from building a drift car to building programs with code.  
                One of my long-term goals is to start a programming career back home in Japan.</p>
